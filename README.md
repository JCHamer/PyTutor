## How to use PyTutor

It's really easy to get started on a Mac!
1. Click on the Green button that says "Clone or download"
  - Click "Download ZIP"
2. At the bottom of your browser window double click PyTutor-master....zip
3. Now open your Applications folder and go to the folder called "Utilities"
  - Open the app called Terminal
4. Once in Terminal, you'll be presented with a big white box where you can enter text and "talk" to the computer. The first thing you will tell it to do is to change to the folder where you downloaded PyTutor to.
  - To do this, just type `cd ~/Downloads/PyTutor-master` and you should be ready for the last step
5. The final step is to tell the computer to actually run PyTutor, to do that simply type `python PyTutor.py` and then follow along with the instructions
